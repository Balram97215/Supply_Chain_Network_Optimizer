## 🎯 The Project at a Glance
This project is a **Digital Twin simulation** designed to solve a classic logistics problem: **Network Optimization.**

Instead of using static Excel analysis to decide where to open a new warehouse, I built a dynamic pipeline that:
1.  **Simulates** 10,000+ realistic orders using skewed probability distributions.
2.  **Calculates** the mathematically optimal warehouse location using **Physics (Center of Gravity)**.
3.  **Visualizes** the result in an interactive dashboard that responds to user "What-If" scenarios.

### 📸 Simulation View
The visual below demonstrates the dynamic calculating engine. The **Red X** represents the mathematically optimal hub location based on the weighted volume of the filtered zones.

> **Business Impact:** The simulation identified a dual-node network (NJ + NV) that reduces West Coast freight costs by **~18%** and cuts delivery times by **4 days**.

## ⚙️ How It Works (The Pipeline)

I moved beyond standard reporting by integrating Python directly into the Power BI calculation engine.

### 💻 Technical Implementation
The dashboard utilizes Python scripts running directly inside Power BI's query editor to handle data processing and visualization plotting (using Matplotlib), as seen below:

### Results & Impact

By moving from a single node (NJ) to a dual node (NJ + NV) network, the simulation demonstrated:
1. **Cost Savings**: The logic identified Nevada (NV) as the optimal second node, reducing Zone 8 freight spend by ~18%.
2. **Speed**: West Coast delivery times dropped from 5 days (Cross-country) to 1 day (Local).
3. **Agility**: The tool allows the logistics team to simulate seasonal shifts (e.g., "Where should we be during Q4 Holiday Rush?") in seconds.
